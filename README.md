# Highline Rescue Project

## What is the project trying to achieve? 

This project tries to investigate if a helicopter-based rescue of a single patient directly off a highline can be done safely. If a safe procedure for a helicopter-based rescue can be found, it can shorten the time-to-hospital for a patient on a highline. This is especially relevant due to suspension trauma developing after prolonged hanging in a harness. 
Therefore, we started some experiments with a longline in collaboration with HeliAustria. Furhtermore, we investigated the cutting resistance of the highlineline in a realistic highline-rescue setting with a hoist cable in collaboration with the Bergwacht Bayern.
The preliminary results of our experiments, which will be presented at the ICAR 2024 and shortly on this website, showed a substantial risk in contact with the hoist cable.
Since then, we identified a climbing rope to pose minimal danger of cutting the highline and started investigating the damage inflicted by contact of the two.

## What already happened in the project

Lukas Irmler, Aaron Benkert, and Jakob Bludau started with the question if a helicopter-based rescue of a patient directly off a highline would be possible. After formulating the first [`Functional Hazard Analysis`](https://github.com/JBludau/Highline-Rescue-Project/blob/main/documents/helikopter_rettung_fha_v2.0_german.pdf) to investigate the risk associated with a rescue, the authors discussed the findings with HeliAustria. This lead to the conception of experiments for a fist investigation of a helicopter-based rescue.

### Longline experiments with HeliAustria

The first experiments were conducted using a longline. The textile material of the longline was suspected to pose less thread of cutting the highline. The highline was constructed in a special way, as stated in the [`Functional Hazard Analysis`](https://github.com/JBludau/Highline-Rescue-Project/blob/main/documents/helikopter_rettung_fha_v2.0_german.pdf). This allowed for ~30 successful (2 terminated as early measure without problems) longline rescues of a patient off a highline.
The taken video material is available on youtube.

### Presentation at ICAR 2023

After the longline experiments with HeliAustria, the results were [presented at ICAR2023](https://github.com/JBludau/Highline-Rescue-Project/blob/main/presentations/icar_2023_highline_rescue_longline.pdf). In the discussion in the plenary after the presentation, it was mentioned, that most of the helicopter rescue operators are not using longlines but rescue hoists in their standard operating procedures. Nevertheless, the authors suspected the thin hoist cable to pose a danger of damaging or even cutting the highline.  

### Hoist cable vs highline test

During ICAR2023, the authors teamed up with with Raed Slacklines and the Bergwacht Bayern to collaborate on investigating the danger in a contact of a helicopter rescue hoist cable and conventional highline materials. The experiment, which was done using a 50m long highline and an original hoist cable showed, that the hoist cable does indeed pose a danger to the highline. The contact was established by having the helicopter hovering at a position that pushes the hoist cable onto the highline near the leash ring (attachment of the patient to the highline). In all 6 valid experiments the highline was cut by the hoist cable after few meters of hoisting while being in contact.
Nevertheless, the study also included the contact between a climbing rope and the highline. As climbing rope did not cut the highline, even under a lot of relative movement between the two materials, a follow up experiment was planned.

### Climbing rope vs highline

In this experiment, the contact between a climbing rope and the highline is investigated explicitly. Therefore, ~5m highlines made from different matierals (polyamide, polyester, and dyneema) were brought in contact with a climbing rope. While keeping the contact on the same spot, the climbing rope was moved relatively to the highline. After 25 cylces a 2m up and 2m down, the highline material was tested for its breakting strength.

### Presentation at ICAR 2024

The results of the contact experiments are presented at ICAR2024 and will be uploaded to the project.
