\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
A Highline rescue is similar to one of a lead climber, a highly technical rescue. Furthermore, the patient is prone to suspension trauma due to long periods of hanging in a harness. Therefore, time is a priority.
Highlines span gaps, ridges, etc. Often, the anchors are only reachable by rappel/climbing. Thus, even if a terrestrial rescue transports the patient to one of the anchors, the way to a hospital is still long. Furthermore, the mode of transport to the hospital is probably a helicopter due to the terrain.\\

With longer Highlines, the rescue is escalating in complexity. Ropes need to be longer, and direct rappel off the Highline is no longer possible or dangerous (stretch in “static” ropes and webbings is not negligible and leads to large vertical movement during rappel). Furthermore, rescuers must pull the patient up for a rescue towards one of the anchors due to the Highline sag. \\

These thoughts lead the authors to discuss a helicopter-based rescue directly off the Highline with Heli Austria (namely Gabriel Falkner). A literature review showed that there is little published experience on this topic.\\

This document contains the thoughts of the authors on a helicopter-based highline rescue. The document shows the stages of the procedure in section \ref{sec:proc}, based on the procedure for an injured lead climber. Section \ref{sec:conventional} describes the conventional setup of a Highline. The authors derived a functional hazard analysis of the rescue procedure in section \ref{sec:fha}. Section \ref{sec:fha} also contains mitigation measures for the most critical risks. Section \ref{sec:modified} describes the resulting Highline setup for safer training. Finally, section \ref{sec:result} lists the procedure and the personal protective equipment in detail. The overall focus is on safety.

This document targets a rescue with a longline as a connection between rescuer and helicopter. Inferring from the contact of climbing ropes with the Highline, the authors suspect the textile longline rope with a diameter of approx. 20mm to have a negligible chance of cutting the Highline. If a thin steel hoist cable used for rotorcraft-based rescue poses a severe threat 


\section{Procedure of lead climber rescue as starting point}
\label{sec:proc}

This document starts with a procedure similar to rescuing a lead climber hanging in a harness from a rope. The load-bearing path defines the phases of this procedure. (The names of the phases are in bold font in the following list)

\begin{itemize}
\item  1st: \textbf{Approach and positioning} of the rotorcraft, including rescuer and rescue equipment above the patient.
\item  2nd: Rappel of rescuer and \textbf{attaching of the patient's harness} to the longline.
\item 3rd: \textbf{Climb of the rotorcraft} to transfer the patient's load off the climbing rope onto the longline.
\item 4th: \textbf{Cutting of the climbing rope} and check that the patient and rescuer are only connected to the rotorcraft.
\item 5th: \textbf{Departure} towards a free direction.
\end{itemize}

From the start of phase 2 until the end of phase 4, the rescue equipment, the harness of the patient, and the climbing rope connect the rotorcraft to the terrain. Nevertheless, the stretch and slack of the climbing rope allow movement in a limited range. \\

During phases 1 and 2, the load-bearing paths of the rescuer and the patient are entirely separate. During phase 3, the patient's load is gradually transferred to the longline. The transfer is complete if the climbing rope is free of load. After the climbing rope cut in phase 4, the rotorcraft carries the load of the rescuer and the patient. \\

This procedure works for a Highline rescue with a few minor modifications. These modifications result from the functional hazard analysis in chapter \ref{sec:fha}. The following shows the resulting procedure. Italics highlight differences between the procedure and the lead climber rescue procedure. 

\begin{itemize}
\item  1st: \textbf{Approach and positioning} of the rotorcraft, including rescuer and rescue equipment above the patient.
\item  2nd: Rappel of rescuer and \textbf{attaching of the patient's harness} to the longline.
\item 3rd: \textbf{Climb of the rotorcraft} to transfer the patient's load off the \textit{Highline} onto the longline. \textit{Furthermore, the rescuer positions the rotorcraft approx. 1m of horizontal distance to the Highline to check if any unwanted connection to the Highline exists}.
\item 4th: \textbf{Cutting of the} \textit{leash} and check that the patient and rescuer are only connected to the rotorcraft.
\item 5th: \textbf{Departure} towards a free direction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conventional highline setup}
\label{sec:conventional}

Conventional Highlines consist of two anchors, a main line, one backup line, a leash ring, the leash, and the athlete's harness. Suitable points for anchors are trees, bolts, and removable equipment like cams, ice screws, or nuts. Anchors are generally redundant. \\
The main and backup lines are hung between the anchors. Personal preference, in combination with the used material, determines the pretension of the main line. The backup line prevents a fatality in case of a mainline failure due to falling debris or friction. It hangs loosely underneath the main line, often in loops. In case of a main line failure, the backup is an entirely redundant connection to the terrain. Nevertheless, this requires sufficient free horizontal distance underneath the line. \\
The main and backup lines go through a closed metal loop called the leash ring. The leash ring is an attachment point that can move along the line. The athlete connects the harness to the leash ring via a 1.2m long leash. This leash often consists of a climbing rope fed through a tubular webbing for redundancy.

\section{Functional hazard analysis and risk mitigation for a safe training setting}
\label{sec:fha}

Two outstanding dangers are present during all phases of the rescue:
\begin{itemize}
\item The backup line, a secondary line that runs parallel to the main line, is a crucial component in the rescue operation. It serves as a safety measure in case the main line fails. However, it's important to note that the backup line can also pose a potential danger of entanglement, as its loops can wrap around arms, legs, or material (on the harness, the longline rig, etc.). This can lead to complex problems that are difficult to solve. In a training environment, using a tubular material that both main line and backup go through is essential to eliminate the danger of entanglement.
\item In the event of a main line rupture, the line snaps back towards the anchors. This snapping action is more pronounced in what we refer to as ``high slack settings'', where there is a significant amount of slack in the line. To reduce the risk of line rupture, the slack of a training line is reduced by increasing the tension in the main line. This, in turn, increases the distance between the main line and the rotorcraft, minimizing the potential for the line to snap back towards the rotorcraft.
\end{itemize} 

The following Functional Hazard Analysis lists the risks of every procedure phase separately. It distinguishes between the functional systems \textit{rotorcraft}, \textit{longline}, \textit{harness}, \textit{leash}, \textit{rescuer}, and \textit{highline}. As the patient might be unconscious,   no functions are associated. 


The risks result from errors/inabilities of the listed systems during the rescue phases. This document lists the expected criticality of the identified risks in all phases of the rescue and proposes mitigation to create a safe training environment. 


The text uses \textit{highline} for the system composed of the two anchors, the main and backup line, and the leash ring as this system fulfills the functions \textbf{load bearing} and \textbf{psotitioning} as a single unit. Nevertheless, the risk lists a breakdown in the description if necessary. 


This document gives the criticality of a risk on three levels \textcolor{green}{low}, \textcolor{orange}{medium}, and \textcolor{red}{high}. The levels encode the complexity that a solution to the problem requires and the potential harm for rescuers, patients, and rotorcraft. Table \ref{tab:crit} gives the different levels.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
 criticality & complexity of solution & potential harm \\ 
 \hline
 \hline 
 \textcolor{green}{low} & no actions necessary & none \\ 
 \hline
 \textcolor{orange}{medium} & 1-2 simple steps, visual check, known communication & small bruises on arms or legs \\ 
 \hline
 \textcolor{red}{high} & \makecell{cutting, thinking thinking, \\ spontaneous problem solving/communication} & \makecell{everything more than \\ small bruises on arms or legs} \\  
   
\end{tabular}
\caption{Levels of criticality described by their complexity and potential harm.}
\label{tab:crit}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:func} gives the functions of the individual systems:
\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c  }
 system & function \\ 
 \hline
 \hline 
 rotorcraft & \makecell{load bearing \\ positioning (with help of rescuer)} \\

 \hline
 leash & load bearing \\
 \hline
 harness (patient) & load bearing \\ 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Systems and respective functions.}
\label{tab:func}
\end{table}

The analysis does not differentiate between different causes of a failure of the rotorcraft to provide the functions \textbf{load bearing} and \textbf{positioning}. The rotorcaft corresponds to a black box system that can change the position in 3D space and lift a load (load bearing). In case of an emergency, the rotorcraft can drop the longline.

Humans perform some of the mitigation that is identified by the analysis. Therefore, the three roles \textcolor{teal}{rescuer}, \textcolor{purple}{patient}, and external \textcolor{blue}{observer} are defined. All humans involved in the training are connected via a shared radio.

\subsection{Phase 1: Approach and Positioning}
\label{sec:fha:phase1}

This phase starts when the systems rotorcraft+\textcolor{teal}{rescuer}+longline interacts with the systems \textcolor{purple}{patient}+highline. This includes aerodynamic interactions (e.g., downwash onto a highline). 

Risks that originate solely from using a rotorcraft+\textcolor{teal}{rescuer}+longline during the approach are \textbf{not} included here.

phases. The function of "disconnecting the patient from the highline" must not be carried out in this phase, as otherwise,
the residual tension in the highline will generate a strong vertical oscillation that can lead to entanglement in the rope,
\textcolor{purple}{patient}, flight \textcolor{teal}{rescuer}, or helicopter and must be avoided at all costs. If the flight \textcolor{teal}{rescuer} initiates the next phase (cutting
the leash) too early, the \textcolor{purple}{patient} will intervene with an early warning.\\

\subsection{Phase 5: Removal}
\label{sec:fha:phase5}

After completing Phase 4, the load-bearing path is limited to the heli, rope, and harnesses alone. In general, the operations in this phase are considered equivalent to a climber rescue.\\
For the sake of completeness, however, it should be mentioned again that backup loops, if present, can be inadvertently wrapped around the extremities or equipment of the \textcolor{teal}{rescuer} and \textcolor{purple}{patient}. This is a critical case due to the potentially tricky dissolution and the resulting consequences. In this analysis, however, a sheathing of the line and the backups is planned. This means that this difficult-to-control danger can be eliminated from the actual scenario for an exercise.


\section{Modified highline setup for training}
\label{sec:modified}

The usual structure of a highline already results in a very high safety standard. As described in Chapter 3, each component's simple redundancy is sufficient for normal use. Nevertheless, for the special case of the planned exercise scenario, we propose a special structure that deviates from the usual structure by adding additional safety components to exclude or minimize the safety concerns already discussed as best as possible.\\
For the special protection of the line and the backup, these are threaded through a 9m long fire hose, positioned in the middle of the line in the area of the \textcolor{purple}{patient}. In addition to solid abrasion protection in the event of contact between the rope/air \textcolor{teal}{rescuer} and the line, the hose also protects against falling parts, e.g., in the event of the

In addition, the loops of the non-tensioned, redundant backup ropes are covered, which prevents entanglement in these
loops as best as possible.\\
To cope with the potentially greater forces acting on the entire system than in normal cases (2 people in the line; in the worst case, dynamic fall of two people including the rope into the line; lateral deflection by helicopter), the anchor points are set up with sufficient safety reserves. Instead of three 10mm bolts, four 12mm bolts are used at the western
anchor point, and a compensating anchor is set up on four healthy trees (trunk diameter approx. 30cm) at the eastern anchor point. A solid, certified highline fabric is mainline (probably RedTube, Slacktivity, minimal breaking strength 36.9kN). For double redundancy in the event of a mainline failure, the backup system uses two separate
core-sheath ropes. In addition to sufficient strength, these offer a higher level of safety in the event of cutting-edge loads from stones at the anchor point or sharp-edged material from the air \textcolor{teal}{rescuer}/\textcolor{purple}{patient}. \\

Instead of just one leash ring as a connection between the leash and the line/backup, two tested leash rings are used to ensure redundancy in the improbable event of a material failure of one ring.

To secure the \textcolor{purple}{patient} on the line, only one strand of new climbing rope is used instead of a regular leash (climbing rope
threaded into a hose band). The movable hose band above the rope makes cutting the leash much more difficult. It carries the risk of the safety not being wholly severed, which creates the very critical situation of the helicopter being tied up without a secure connection between the flight \textcolor{teal}{rescuer}/\textcolor{purple}{patient} and the line in the event of the rope being released. Using a single climbing rope makes the situation comparable to a climber's rescue from a rope.

\section{Resulting procedure for training}
\label{sec:result}

Based on the error analysis, some positions in the procedure that should be expanded to increase
the safety of those involved during the exercise can be identified. The assumed procedure from Chapter 2 is repeated below.
Further coordination/elaboration with pilots and air \textcolor{teal}{rescuer}s, and further adjustments are explicitly
desired.
